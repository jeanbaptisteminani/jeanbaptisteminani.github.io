## Research Statement
My research lies at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, with a strong focus on software testing, requirements engineering, and system architectures. I am particularly interested in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs to automate test generation and system validation from natural language documents such as use case specifications and product manuals. During my Ph.D. at Concordia University, I addressed real-world challenges in testing complex IoT and government systems by proposing foundational taxonomies, empirically validated frameworks, and novel test automation strategies. 

My recent work explores integrating AI to generate reliable, reproducible test cases without relying on manually crafted rules or large training datasets, while minimizing hallucinations from LLMs. I aim to advance the field by developing scalable tools for automated testing, detecting design anti-patterns in microservice architectures, and building open-source platforms that support empirical research and industrial collaboration. My research is grounded in real-world applicability and aims to bridge academic innovation with practical impact.

## Teaching Philosophy
As a passionate educator and researcher in software engineering with over 14 years of teaching and mentoring experience, I strive to create an inclusive, engaging, and intellectually stimulating environment. My teaching philosophy emphasizes a balance between foundational knowledge and hands-on learning, helping students build both confidence and practical skills to solve real-world problems.

I prioritize project-based learning to bridge theory with application. Whether guiding students through the design of a LinkedIn-like platform or mentoring interns on government software projects, I encourage creativity, critical thinking, and teamwork. My experience spans diverse educational contexts from undergraduate teaching at AUCA and graduate-level assistance at Carnegie Mellon University to supporting software engineering courses during my Ph.D. at Concordia University.

I adapt my methods based on student feedback, promote collaboration through open-source contributions, and integrate real-world challenges to inspire ownership and motivation. I believe that instructors play a transformative role not just in teaching concepts, but in shaping studentsâ€™ careers and personal growth.
